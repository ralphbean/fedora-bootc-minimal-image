# In order to make a base image as part of a Dockerfile, this container build uses
# nested containerization, so you must build with e.g.
# podman build --security-opt=label=disable --cap-add=all --device /dev/fuse <...>

# NOTE: This container build will output a single giant layer. It is strongly recommended
# to run the "rechunker" on the output of this build, see
# https://coreos.github.io/rpm-ostree/experimental-build-chunked-oci/

# Override this repos container to control the base image package versions. For
# example, podman build --from=quay.io/fedora/fedora:41 will get you a system
# that uses Fedora 41 packages. Or inject arbitrary yum repos (COPR, etc) here.
